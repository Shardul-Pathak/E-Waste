          <li>📱 <strong>Smartphones & Tablets</strong> – Includes broken screens, old models, or unused devices.</li>
          <li>💻 <strong>Laptops & Desktops</strong> – Recycled for components like CPUs, RAM, and hard drives.</li>
          <li>🖨️ <strong>Printers & Scanners</strong> – Deconstructed for plastic, metal, and ink cartridge recycling.</li>
          <li>🔌 <strong>Cables, Chargers & Adaptors</strong> – Stripped for copper, aluminum, and safe insulation disposal.</li>
          <li>🔋 <strong>Batteries (All types)</strong> – Properly processed to prevent toxic leakage of lithium, lead, etc.</li>
          <li>📺 <strong>TVs & Monitors</strong> – CRTs or LCDs handled with care for glass and hazardous material separation.</li>
          <li>🖱️ <strong>Computer Accessories</strong> – Includes keyboards, mice, webcams, speakers, and more.</li>

      <!-- How We Recycle -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>⚙️ How We Recycle</h2>
        <p>
          Our recycling process follows internationally certified e-waste protocols to ensure environmental and worker safety. Here’s how it works:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Collection:</strong> Devices are gathered through drop-off centers or pickup requests.</li>
          <li><strong>Sorting:</strong> Items are categorized into reusable, recyclable, and hazardous groups.</li>
          <li><strong>Dismantling:</strong> Devices are manually and mechanically dismantled into components.</li>
          <li><strong>Material Recovery:</strong> Valuable metals like gold, silver, and copper are extracted using eco-friendly methods.</li>
          <li><strong>Toxic Handling:</strong> Harmful parts like batteries, mercury lamps, and e-liquid waste are safely treated or neutralized.</li>
          <li><strong>Re-manufacturing:</strong> Recovered materials are sent for reuse in manufacturing new electronics.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <!-- Why Recycling Matters -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>🌍 Why Recycling Matters</h2>
        <p>
          E-waste is the fastest-growing waste stream globally. Improper disposal leads to severe consequences such as soil degradation, water pollution, and air contamination. Here's why e-waste recycling is essential:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>🌐 <strong>Resource Conservation:</strong> Electronics contain valuable metals like gold, copper, and rare earths that can be reused.</li>
          <li>💣 <strong>Prevention of Toxic Pollution:</strong> Improperly discarded electronics leak substances like lead and mercury.</li>
          <li>🔥 <strong>Reduction of Carbon Footprint:</strong> Manufacturing from recycled materials uses less energy compared to raw materials.</li>
          <li>🛡️ <strong>Data Security:</strong> Devices are securely wiped or destroyed to ensure complete data privacy.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Impact on Environment -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>🌱 How It Helps the Environment & The World</h2>
        <p>
          Every piece of e-waste recycled helps reduce the strain on Earth's natural resources and prevents further environmental damage. Here's the impact:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>🌳 <strong>Environmental Restoration:</strong> Reduced mining demand means less deforestation and ecosystem destruction.</li>
          <li>🏭 <strong>Cleaner Cities:</strong> Proper recycling prevents landfill overflow and air pollution from incineration.</li>
          <li>🌊 <strong>Healthier Oceans:</strong> Reducing toxic runoff helps protect marine life and aquatic ecosystems.</li>
          <li>🤝 <strong>Community Jobs:</strong> Recycling programs create jobs in collection, repair, sorting, and research sectors.</li>
          <li>📉 <strong>Global Waste Reduction:</strong> Promotes a circular economy where materials are reused instead of discarded.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Together, we can build a more sustainable and waste-free future. Let’s protect our planet — one recycled device at a time.
